    <h1>Why Typing Speed Matters</h1>

    <img src="img1.jpg" alt="Typing illustration" class="about-image">

    <p>
      Typing isn't just a convenience anymore. It's a daily tool, and in many jobs, it's one of the most used skills. Every message you write, every form you fill out, every line of code you type depends on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you're applying for a job, typing speed can actually help you stand out. Employers see it as a sign of how efficiently you work. In some roles, it's even tested. Being able to type quickly means you can get more done in less time. That makes a real difference.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Impacts Programmers</h2>

    <p>
      For programmers, speed matters in a different way. It's not about how many words you can type in a minute, but how smoothly you can keep up with your own thinking. Coding is creative. When you're in the flow, typing should never slow you down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fast typists move faster through their code. They navigate files more easily, refactor quicker, and waste less time on repetitive actions. Over days, weeks, and months, that efficiency adds up.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're debugging, writing scripts, or working on large projects, a smooth typing rhythm can keep you focused and productive. When your hands can keep up with your brain, it feels like everything just clicks. That’s when the best work happens.
    </p>
